                    <h3>Differentiating Between Indirect and Direct Unvented Megaflo Systems</h3>
                    <p>Megaflo systems come in two variations: indirect and direct. Let’s explore their differences:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Indirect Unvented Megaflo:</strong>
                        In this configuration, the hot water supplied by an external source, such as a regular or system boiler, heats the water stored in the cylinder. The cylinder’s coil ensures the water temperature remains consistent based on the thermostat settings. When hot water is used, the boiler refills the cylinder to maintain an ample supply.</li>
                        <li><strong>Direct Unvented Megaflo:</strong>
                        This type of Megaflo system utilizes the mains cold water supply as its primary source. Inside the cylinder, a Megaflo immersion heater switch, powered by electricity, heats the water to the desired temperature defined by the thermostat. When hot water is drawn, the system replenishes the supply with cold water from the main feed.that both indirect and direct unvented Megaflo systems offer reliable and efficient hot water solutions for your home. The choice between the two depends on your specific requirements and preferences.</li>
                    </ol>
